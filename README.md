# Odin Project course - Rock Paper Scissors

I am creating a Rock Paper Scissors game as part of the Foundations course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

- Added a function (computerPlay) to randomly generate string from an array (choice).
- Added another function with an if else statement to check between player and computer choice, determining which is the winner of each game.
