# Odin Project course - Rock Paper Scissors

I am creating a Rock Paper Scissors game as part of the Foundations course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

- Added a function (computerPlay) to randomly generate string from an array (choice).
- Added another function (playRound) with an if else statement to check between player and computer choice, determining which is the winner of each game.
- Created variables to hold the score from the user, computer and draws.
- Created variables to display the messages for the various results.
- Created a function (game) that had a for loop in it, which prompted the player for their selection, called in the (computerPlay), then compared the results from each round (playRound) and added it to the players/computers score, which was logged. Then added an if/else statement to compare the scores and log the winner.
